# Meeting Todo & Answer
## June 23, 2023
1. Verify the Fed dataset
	1. The dummy for Procurement and Financial Assistance (just saw from a government brochure that this level of stratification is caused by data source difference)
2. Verify the State level data
	1. If payment data cover both contract payment and direct payment 
3. Action
	1. Improve Federal Variable List
	2. Add “Award Type” variable to Fed-level data 
	3. After understanding “types” of data reported in Fed level data, give a definition of amount and how we can use them
	4. Give a breakdown (distribution) on amount (contract value) by 9 groups of award data types (to understand the relevancy/representation/importance of each type)

>[!faq]- Employee salaries in non-award data
>
>The employees refer to **government employees**, according to "For example, account spending includes money used to **pay federal government employees’ salaries**. This spending is not included in award spending" from [Federal Spending Guide](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal-spending-guide)

>[!info]- Direct Payment (A type of Financial Assistance)
>
>A cash payment made by the federal government to an individual, **a private firm**, or another private institution.

> [!info]- Direct Payment for Specified Use
> 
> **Financial assistance** provided by the federal government directly to individuals, **private firms**, and other private institutions for a particular activity. 
> 
> To receive this assistance, the recipient must perform certain agreed-upon activities and meet certain milestones. **Direct payments don’t include solicited contracts for the procurement of goods and services for the government**.

>[!info]- Direct Payment with Unrestricted Use
>
>**Financial assistance** provided by the federal government directly to beneficiaries who meet certain federal **eligibility requirements**. This type of assistance doesn’t place any restrictions on how the recipient spends the money. Some examples of direct payments include **retirement, pension, and compensatory programs**.
