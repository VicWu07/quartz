# Profitability as a measure of cost of capital for different startups
- spaceship, aircraft, AI, etc. may have lower cost of capital because their profit comes much later
- meat delivery company like the ones in the podcast have a high cost of capital that prevent them from seeking money from venture capitals
	- and maybe they value advisors and other resources provided by VPs lower? (What is the field of this type of research?)
